# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.


## How to run this project
*Open the index.html file to load the feedreader. All the original tests now pass.
*An additional test has been added and allowed to fail.


## Additional test
*An additional test has been written for a feature to mark articles links that have been read by the user. The test expects that a 'marked-read' class be added to a feed link that has been clicked. The corresponding CSS rule for the 'marked-read' class should change the color of the link to let the user know that the link has been visited before. This method can allow additional features such as marking all items as read or removing items marked as read.
